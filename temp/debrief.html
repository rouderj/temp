<center><h2>Explanation</h2></center>
    
<p>Each of these tasks measured how much your perception of a target stimulus is affected by the background. In the first task the arrow heads affect how long you perceive each line to be (called the Muller-Lyer illusion). In the second task the rectangle makes the two lines appear to be along the same path even when they are in fact offset (Poggendorff illusion). In the third task the surrounding lines make the lines in the center look tilted away from vertical even when they are perfectly up and down (tilt repulsion illusion). In the forth task the train track background makes the two lines appear to be of different heights even when they are exactly the same height on the screen (Ponzo Illusion). In the last task, surrounding a letter by Hs makes it appear more A-like, and surrounding it by As makes it more H-like.</p>

<p>In all of these illusions your perception of a stimulus is distorted by the background. The goal of this study is to determine whether people who are more or less affected by the background in one task are also more or less affected by the background in the other tasks. Examining how people differ in the degree to which they are affected by the background across these tasks will allow us to better understand why these illusions occur at all.</p>
